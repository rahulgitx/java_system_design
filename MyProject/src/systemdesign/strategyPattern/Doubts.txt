Why not inheritance ??

If we choose multi level inheritance we'll go by a heirarchy such as
                                       Vehicle
                                    /            \
                     NormalDriveVehicle               SpecialDriveVehicle
                     /            \                 /                   \
             TransportVehicle  GoodsVehicle        SportsCar       OffRoadCar


but here suppose we have a new method manufactureCompany() which also have a type say A and B and we want to save the code
duplicacy again

so to introduce this in multi level inheritance we'll have to add this in the second
                                                                                           Vehicle
                                                                                     /                    \
                                                                      CompanyTypeA                      CompanyTypeB
                                                                     /           \                         /               \
                     NormalDriveVehicle               SpecialDriveVehicle                   NormalDriveVehicle               SpecialDriveVehicle
                     /            \                 /                   \                       /            \                 /                   \
             TransportVehicle  GoodsVehicle        SportsCar       OffRoadCar           TransportVehicle  GoodsVehicle        SportsCar       OffRoadCar


             this is making the structure more complex and is enforcing to make more changes violating the open closed principle.
